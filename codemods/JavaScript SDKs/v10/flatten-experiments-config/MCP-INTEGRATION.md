# MCP Integration for Codemod Development

This document explains how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to improve your codemod development workflow.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with various tools and services. In the context of codemod development, MCP tools can significantly enhance your development process.

## Available MCP Tools for Codemod Development

### 1. **AST Analysis Tools** (ast-grep MCP)
- **Purpose**: Replace fragile regex patterns with robust AST-based transformations
- **Benefits**: More accurate code parsing, handles complex syntax, less prone to errors
- **Usage**: Use `ast-grep` patterns instead of regex for code transformation

### 2. **Code Quality Tools** (biome MCP)
- **Purpose**: Automated linting, formatting, and code quality checks
- **Benefits**: Consistent code style, catch potential issues early
- **Usage**: Run `npx biome check --write` for automatic fixes

### 3. **File System Tools**
- **Purpose**: Better file management and testing
- **Benefits**: Automated test file generation, batch processing
- **Usage**: Create comprehensive test suites automatically

### 4. **Git Integration Tools**
- **Purpose**: Version control and change tracking
- **Benefits**: Track changes, create meaningful commits
- **Usage**: Automate git operations for better change management

### 5. **Web Search Tools**
- **Purpose**: Research best practices and solutions
- **Benefits**: Stay updated with latest patterns and techniques
- **Usage**: Search for coding patterns and solutions

## How to Use MCP with Your Codemod

### Step 1: Start MCP Server
```bash
npx codemod mcp
```

### Step 2: Use MCP Tools in Development

#### AST-Based Transformation
Instead of regex:
```typescript
// ❌ Fragile regex approach
sourceText = sourceText.replace(
  /_experiments:\s*{\s*enableLogs:\s*([^,}]+),\s*beforeSendLog:\s*([^}]*(?:\{[^}]*\})?[^}]*)\s*,?\s*},?/gm,
  'enableLogs: $1,\n    beforeSendLog: $2,'
);
```

Use AST patterns:
```typescript
// ✅ Robust AST approach
const sentryInitCalls = root.findAll({
  pattern: "Sentry.init($$$ARGS)",
});
```

#### Automated Code Quality
```bash
# Run biome for linting and formatting
npx biome check --write ./scripts/codemod.ts
npx biome format --write ./scripts/codemod.ts
```

#### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Run the development workflow
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh
```

### Step 3: Integrate MCP into Your Workflow

1. **Development Phase**:
   - Use AST tools for accurate code transformation
   - Use biome for code quality
   - Use file system tools for test generation

2. **Testing Phase**:
   - Use comprehensive test suites
   - Use performance monitoring
   - Use edge case testing

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Use git tools for version control
   - Use web search for best practices
   - Use automated workflows

## Benefits of MCP Integration

### 1. **Improved Accuracy**
- AST-based transformations are more reliable than regex
- Handles complex syntax correctly
- Less prone to edge case failures

### 2. **Better Code Quality**
- Automated linting and formatting
- Consistent code style
- Early detection of issues

### 3. **Enhanced Testing**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Automated test generation
- Edge case validation

### 4. **Streamlined Workflow**
- Automated development processes
- Better change tracking
- Improved collaboration

## Example MCP-Enhanced Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start MCP server
npx codemod mcp

# 2. Run development workflow
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh

# 3. Test your codemod
npm test

# 4. Deploy with confidence
npm publish
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use AST tools** for code transformation instead of regex
2. **Integrate biome** for consistent code quality
3. **Create comprehensive tests** using MCP file system tools
4. **Use git tools** for proper version control
5. **Leverage web search** for research and best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AST pattern not matching**: Check pattern syntax and test with simple cases
2. **Biome errors**: Run `npx biome check` to see specific issues
3. **Test failures**: Use MCP file tools to debug test cases

### Getting Help
- Use web search MCP tools to find solutions
- Check ast-grep documentation for pattern syntax
- Use biome MCP tools to understand linting rules

## Conclusion

MCP integration transforms your codemod development from a manual, error-prone process to an automated, reliable workflow. By leveraging these tools, you can create more robust, maintainable, and accurate codemods that handle complex code transformations with confidence.
