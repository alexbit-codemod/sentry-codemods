# Codemods

This directory contains placeholders for versioned codemods and optional recipes.

- Codemod: a single published transformation package (not stored here).
- Recipe: a daisy-chained orchestration of multiple codemods.

Structure:

```
vX/
  <codemod-name>/        # optional placeholder for docs/metadata only
  migration-recipe/      # optional orchestration, when applicable
```
